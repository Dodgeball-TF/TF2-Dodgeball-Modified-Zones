# Descrption

This subplugin adds a few extra events to be used with the configuration system.

For now there's only one event : `on destroyed`.

More details about each event can be found in the [configuration file](https://github.com/x07x08/TF2-Dodgeball-Modified/blob/main/TF2Dodgeball/addons/sourcemod/configs/dodgeball/general.cfg).
